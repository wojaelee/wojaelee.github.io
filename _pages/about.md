# Career Summary
* I am a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [John W. Sutherland](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LSM/people/jws). [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_j_0jLYg2kcC&hl=en)]
* I am developing a broad understanding of engineering and gaining a wide variety of smart manufacturing experience through collaborations with other researchers and local manufacturing companies. I currently work as a research assistant funded by “In-Mac” (Indiana Next Generation Manufacturing Competitiveness Center). I am involved in “WHIN” (Wabash Heartland Innovation Network) project, whose vision is to make the Wabash Heartland (10-county region in the state of Indiana) the global epicenter for next-generation manufacturing empowered by smart “Internet of Things” platforms. My recent research at Purdue is to build a deep learning enabled predictive maintenance (PdM) monitoring system to detect mechanical defects and forecast remaining useful life (i.e., time to failure) under dynamic operational conditions (e.g., variable rotational speed). I collaborate with several local companies to decrease the cost of downtime and to increase the utilization of manufacturing equipment using the PdM monitoring system. I have acquired skills in Machine/Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Multivariate Time-series Analysis, Statistical Process Control, Design of Experiments, Stochastic Modelling, Statistical Analysis and Modeling, Digital Signal Processing, Process Design, Design for Manufacturability, Life Cycle Assessment, CATIA, LabVIEW, Python, and Matlab.
