# Who am I?
* I am a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [John W. Sutherland](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LSM/people/jws). [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_j_0jLYg2kcC&hl=en)]
* I am developing a broad understanding of engineering and gaining a wide variety of smart manufacturing experience through collaborations with other researchers and local manufacturing companies. I currently work as a research assistant funded by “In-Mac” (Indiana Next Generation Manufacturing Competitiveness Center). I am involved in “WHIN” (Wabash Heartland Innovation Network) project, whose vision is to make the Wabash Heartland (10-county region in the state of Indiana) the global epicenter for next-generation manufacturing empowered by smart “Internet of Things” platforms. My recent research at Purdue is to build a deep learning enabled predictive maintenance (PdM) monitoring system to detect mechanical defects and forecast remaining useful life (i.e., time to failure) under dynamic operational conditions (e.g., variable rotational speed). I collaborate with several local companies to decrease the cost of downtime and to increase the utilization of manufacturing equipment using the PdM monitoring system. I have acquired skills in Machine/Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Multivariate Time-series Analysis, Statistical Process Control, Design of Experiments, Stochastic Modelling, Statistical Analysis and Modeling, Digital Signal Processing, Process Design, Design for Manufacturability, Life Cycle Assessment, CATIA, LabVIEW, Python, and Matlab.

# News

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
